# ESG Readiness Operating Model — Professional Services SMEs

This repository documents the design of an ESG readiness operating model for mid-sized professional services organisations. The work focuses on the *operational* side of ESG — structuring data, evidence, and internal processes so that sustainability and ESG questionnaires can be handled efficiently, consistently, and with reduced pressure.

The case study reflects independent, real-world system design work rather than theoretical ESG strategy or policy development.

## Context

Professional services SMEs are increasingly required to respond to ESG and sustainability questionnaires as part of client onboarding, procurement processes, and investor due diligence. These requests are often indirect, inconsistent in format, and arrive with short deadlines.

In many SMEs, relevant ESG information exists across HR, operations, finance, and leadership, but is rarely centralised or governed. As a result, questionnaire responses are frequently handled reactively, creating operational strain and increasing the risk of inconsistency.

This case study documents the design and implementation of an ESG readiness operating model that addresses these challenges in a practical, maintainable way, enabling repeatable and low-friction questionnaire responses.

## Supporting Artefacts (Mock / Anonymised)

To preserve confidentiality, supporting artefacts are presented as mock or anonymised examples. These demonstrate structure and design rather than real client data.

Supporting artefacts include:
- ESG KPI Tracker 
- Evidence folder structure
- Salesforce tracking model
- Questionnaire guidance examples
- Summary reporting format

These artefacts reflect the structures and templates referenced in the case study.

**ESG KPI Tracker – Overview (Mock)** 

A structured ESG KPI tracker designed for professional services SMEs to support client onboarding, procurement, and investor due diligence questionnaires.

The tracker:
- Centralises ESG ownership across Environment, Social, and Governance
- Maps KPIs directly to common questionnaire usage
- Highlights gaps and next actions to reduce reactive data requests
- Supports ongoing maintenance via review dates and ownership

 
High-level view of ESG coverage across Environmental, Social, and Governance areas, showing ownership, status, typical questionnaire usage, and next actions.

*This overview enables quick assessment of ESG readiness and highlights gaps before questionnaires or due diligence requests arise.*

*All artefacts in this repository are mock or illustrative but reflect real-world ESG readiness design principles. No sensitive or fabricated client data is included.*

**ESG Evidence Index – Overview (Mock)**

A structured ESG evidence index designed for professional services SMEs to support consistent, auditable responses to client onboarding, procurement, and investor due diligence questionnaires.

The evidence index:
- Maps ESG metrics and questionnaire topics to supporting documentation
- Records ownership and review cadence for each evidence item
- Improves traceability between KPIs, policies, and source files
- Documents assumptions and known limitations transparently

High-level view of ESG evidence coverage, showing how metrics link to documentation, owners, and review timelines.

*This evidence index acts as a single source of truth, reducing time spent locating documentation and improving consistency across ESG questionnaire responses.*

---

**ESG Evidence Pack – Structure (Mock)**

A structured ESG evidence pack designed to organise supporting documentation in a clear, maintainable way for professional services SMEs.

The evidence pack:
- Separates Environmental, Social, and Governance documentation
- Supports clear ownership and accountability for ESG evidence
- Enables faster responses to ad-hoc data and evidence requests
- Provides a scalable structure that can mature as requirements increase

Illustrative view of the folder structure used to store and govern ESG supporting documents.

*This structure ensures ESG evidence is easy to locate, review, and maintain, reducing operational friction during onboarding, procurement, and due diligence.*
